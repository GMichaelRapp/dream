## 03: Playing the Game
> In this chapter, players are introduced to how the game works mechanically. Parts of this chapter have been reproduced in the **PLAYER REFERENCE SHEET** and the **REFEREE CHEAT SHEET**.

#### Reading the Dice
There are three (3) kinds of dice that are used to either determine success (or failure) or develop encounters, challenges, and locales that IHLs will deal with in-game. The first, and most common, is the six-sided die (referred to as a d6). The scores produced on a singular d6 range from one (1) to six (6). The second, again a common die, is the ten-sided die (referred to as a d10). This die has ten sides, which produce results from one (1) to ten (represented as 0, sometimes 10). The final dice type used in **Pursuing *the* Dream** is a hundred-sided die (referred to as a d100). This die, comprised of two ten-sided dice (see below), produces results ranging from zero (represented as 00 on two ten-sided dice) up to ninety-nine (99). Lower is always better on a d100.

There are often two kinds of ten-sided dice sold at game shops, online retailers, and elsewhere. A standard ten-sided die has results between 01 and 10 (which is represented as a zero (0) on a single, standard d10). It has become increasingly common in game shop dice sets to see a d10 that has **1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0**, and a second, accompanying d10 with **10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 00**. A combination of **00** and **0** should still be read as a zero (0) score (see table below).

| d10 (Tens)  | d10 (Ones) |d100 (Score) |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|00|0|0|
|00|1|01|
|0| 0| 0|
|90|9|99|
|9|9|99|
|1|1|11|
|50|9|59|
|3|8|38|
|20|0|20|
|2|0|20|

#### Dice Notation
Dice are referred to through their shorthand dice notations: e.g., d6 (six-sided die), d10 (ten-sided die), and d100 (a hundred-sided die). If more than one form of die is required it will be presented in this way: 3d6 (three six-sided dice), 2d10 (two ten-sided dice), etc. You might be asked to add, subtract, or multiple your roll results: 3d6+2 (roll three six-sided dice and add two the results), 1d10-1 (Roll a ten-sided die and subtract one from the results), or d100x5 (roll a hundred-sided die and multiply the results by five).

#### Rolling the Dice
A d100, comprised of two (2) ten-sided dice, which designates one ten-sided die as the tens digit (say a red or black die) and the other as the ones digit (say a white or blue die), is the main die for resolving conflict, completing tasks, etc., outside of critical thinking, problem-solving, and roleplaying abilities in **Pursuing *the* Dream**.

**00** is always read as zero (0) and not as one hundred (100). The lowest numeric score possible is zero (0), and the highest numeric score is ninety-nine (99).

When rolling a d100 in **Pursuing *the* Dream**, lower is always better. _Lower_ dice rolls mean more impactful successes. _Higher_ tends to mean more problematic failures. 00 is an automatic success. In most cases, 99 is considered an automatic failure.

#### The Core Mechanic
Everything an IHL might attempt **that could** result in **consequential** failure is resolved by testing one of six (6) attributes stats using a d100. To successfully test an attribute stat, an IHL’s players must roll **below or equal to** the stat in question on a d100 (referred to as a **_target number_**). For example, (say) an IHL is having trouble with its computers and needs to resolve this before serious problems occur. The referee rules that the IHL’s players must make an Infrastructure (INFR) check, using the INFR stat score as the target number. This IHL has a score of 75 for INFR, which means the players must roll **below or equal to** 75 on the d100 to succeed. The players fail their attribute test if they roll higher than this score of 75.

The core mechanic can be complicated by adding in modifiers for difficulty. These difficulty modifiers either act as bonuses (raising the target number) or penalties (lowering the target number). For example, the same Infrastructure (INFR) test could be made easier, as the task is quite trivial, meaning the referee might raise the target ceiling by (say) positive ten (+10) points. This would then mean the IHL players would need to score an 85 or lower to succeed. However, this INFR test might be complicated and made difficult by lowering the target number, especially if the referee believes the task is anything but trivial. So, the INFR check might be given a negative ten (-10) modifier, meaning it is a Great (-10) challenge on the table found below: The check would then need to be passed by rolling a 65 or lower.

An IHL’s **_resources_** and **_characteristics_** can add or subtract additional modifiers, which result in bonuses or penalties depending on the context.

#### Difficulty Descriptors & Difficulty Modifiers
Below referees will find the difficulty modifiers and their associated descriptors. Task examples have been offered as well.

>  **Please Note:** The task examples are not exhaustive, but they are representative.

| Difficulty Descriptor  | Difficulty Modifier |Task Example |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Nearly Impossible | -60 (or higher) |Convince the state’s legislature to improve funding models so they are equitable, especially for rural and underfunded IHLs within the state.|
| Legendary | -50 |Restore campus network after major cyberattack via e-mail-based ransomware.|
| Epic | -40 |Complete last-minute, highly competitive grant application process and get the grant for the school!|
| Fantastic | -30 |Repair IHL’s roof after torrential floods and apocalyptic hail damage and remain open for students and members of the community.|
| Superb | -20 |Switch _all_ courses to some form of online educational mode due to unforeseen pandemic.|
| Great | -10 |Coordinate with other institutions statewide to adopt new curriculum changes mandated by the state’s DHL.|
| Fair | -5 |Find adequate training for faculty and staff concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion.|
| Mundane | +/- 0 |Maintain adequate paperwork for reporting purposes.|
| Simple | +5/+10/+15|Provide a large number of students with an adequate (and exciting) campus tour.|
| Effortless | +30 (or higher) No Dice Rolls Needed. Roleplay Required. Automatic Success If Roleplay Is Convincing.|Clean up trash after rowdy community members who used campus for a weekend convention.|

#### Additional Modifiers
There are additional modifiers that can be added or subtracted from the target number calculated by the referee. These modifiers can be as low as ***minus thirty*** (**-30**) or as high as ***plus thirty*** (**+30**). These are similar in vain as a foot wedge in golf. Play in by ear and go from there.

#### Doubles, Critical Successes, & Critical Failures
Below players will find a table cataloging all possible dice roll combinations for a d100, including **doubles**. Lower rolls are always better when it comes to d100 results in **Pursuing *the* Dream**. However, **rolling a double** can unlock special bonuses or penalties, depending on the context.

> **Please Note:** The referee has the final say on how doubles are used within the game. Doubles are a great way to encourage participation and get players excited about rolling dice and participating in the game. Doubles can make the game more intense, and they grab players’ collective attention. It is recommended that referees use doubles to engage and add tension in gameplay.

The table below offers referees a guide to navigating dice rolls on a d100, along with those critical failures/successes known as doubles.
