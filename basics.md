#### What Is This? {#what-id}
This is a strategy roleplaying game, a blending of strategy- and competition-based games, such as *Risk* or even *Diplomacy*, with tabletop roleplaying games, such as *Dungeons & Dragons*. The idea here is that players take on roles of institutions of higher learning (IHLs) based in the fictional state of Deseret. As players take on these roles, they are strategizing how they will win the one hundred (100) coveted ***victory points*** and beat their competitors—that is, the other IHLs found within the game and taken on by fellow players. 

#### What *Is* a Strategy Roleplaying Game? {#rpg-id}
If strategy roleplaying games are new to you, they can feel daunting when attempting to tackle them as a concept.  Don't worry, though. Strategy roleplaying games are about friendly competition and constructive collaboration between players, even for the game's referee. While competition does exist, it is best to remember the word ***collaboration*** here. Collaboration is a form of entertainment and a way to produce exciting outcomes and not boring, uneventful gaming experiences. Quite the opposite. Collaboration between institutions of higher learning (IHLs) (and even between individual players) is the best way to develop each IHL, explore the future of higher education, and craft wonderful, enriching experiences that will stick with each player. 

Two important aspects of strategy roleplaying games, aside from competition and collaboration, are ***strategy*** and ***roleplaying***.      

In terms of strategy, players acting as (say) Archuleta Community College (ACC) are going to determine the direction of the college, the policies enacted, and even the aggressiveness of (say) its dual enrollment and recruiting programs. Strategy means thinking ahead, thinking of hiccups, or stumbling points, that might lie ahead, and determining the best use of resources and an IHL’s characteristics. In other words, strategy is more than mere competition with other players, hoping to defeat them in the game; it is about thinking forward and thinking in the long term.

In essence, roleplaying games require most individual players to take on an (often) fictional persona, which has been tailored for the game. In **Pursuing *the* Dream**, players, as a group, take on the persona of an established institution of higher learning (IHL) within the fictional state of Deseret. For example, ACC, a small, rural community college nestled in the San Juan Mountains, might be a group’s persona. As ACC, we’ll use its abbreviated name, players will interact with their fellow competitors and their in-game personas, along with the referee(s) and their non-player characters (NPCs) and other encounters. ACC might also interact with the referee in how a situation might be roleplayed, how something might progress forward, and how challenging a given task might be. In all, players playing as ACC are indistinguishable from ACC as an institution. Everything ACC wants, the players want. Everything ACC does, the players have a hand in from the get-go. When the referee interacts with ACC, it is on the basis that the players playing ACC are acting in the best interests of their institution of higher learning, Archuleta Community College.

#### Collaboration & Competition {#collab-id}

> **Remember:** We are wanting to create meaningful experiences here. Meaningful experiences are how we get players to connect with the **_why_** of higher education.

#### Object of the Game {#object-id}
To win a game of **Pursuing *the* Dream**, an IHL must obtain **_at least_** one hundred (100) victory points. Once this victory condition has been met, the referee will announce that the victory condition has been satisfied to all teams involved. All IHLs begin their journey toward pursuing **_the_** dream with zero (0) victory points. Victory points are awarded by the game’s referee(s), who assign victory points based on how well a given IHL accomplishes certain objectives, tackles challenges, expands its influence, and roleplays a given situation in-game.

#### Secondary Role of *ALL* Players {#second-id}
For those who are playing as IHLs, and even those acting as referees, there is a secondary role each player **_must_** fulfill: Make this an enjoyable (and collective) experience. In other words, **Pursuing *the* Dream** is best experienced and enjoyed as a collaborative storytelling and a friendly competition-based endeavor, with everyone, not just the referees, sharing ideas and looking into opportunities to make the game exciting, entertaining, and a collective endeavor worth pursuing altogether.

#### Balacing *Realism* & *Entertainment* {#balance-id}
Self-proclaimed realists will decry the lack of realism in this game (and others like it). That is fine. Realism is in the eye of the beholder, meaning realism comes in different shades and is (often) subjective, particularly in a gameplay context. What is realistic to one is unrealistic to another entirely. While realism is considered here, it is sacrificed in the name of **_good_** entertainment and **_exciting_** gameplay. It is best to remember that ultra-realism is incredibly difficult to nail down in gaming and to simply obsess over all the things that should be realistic would present some serious design challenges, preventing this game from being in your hands, here and now. Overall, remember that realism, or the level or shade of realism desired, should be a group decision, not an individual one. In other words, the group playing should decide how far it wants to take the realism in **Pursuing *the* Dream**.

#### Players & Institutions of Higher Learning (IHLs) {#ihl-id}
This game, **Pursuing *the* Dream**, is best played with large groups of players, with **_a minimum_** of eleven or twelve players, and in a format most conducive for large-group gameplay. A game of **Pursuing *the* Dream** might be played via e-mail, in a large conference room, or across campus, over hours or days, depending on the time constraints that might limit gameplay for your gaming group.

At the start of the game, players are grouped into ten (10) IHLs. These IHLs are as follows: **_Archuleta Community College_ (ACC)**, **_Central Deseret Junior College_ (CDJC)**, **_Eastern Deseret State College_ (EDSC)**, **_Eastern Highlands College_ (EHC)**, **_High Country Community College_ (HCCC)**, **_Northern Deseret State College_ (NDSC)**, **_San Juan Regional College_ (SJRC)**, **_Southern Deseret Community College_ (SDCC)**, **_Tablelands Technical-Vocational College_ (TTVC)**, AND _**Zinc Valley Community College**_ **(ZVCC)**.

Players who **_are not_** assigned to an IHL are to be the game’s referee. More on this later.

> **Please note:** All IHLs found in **Pursuing *the* Dream** are spread throughout the fictional state of Deseret. These IHLs are usually smaller, independent colleges and universities that exist on the peripheries or in the shadows of the larger, wealthier, and politically heavyweight colleges and universities found along the Pacific coastal regions and in the highly developed urban areas.

Each IHL has a particular color for map marking during gameplay. These colors can be found in the table below. If you don’t have access to these colors, please consider modifying them.

| IHL  | Map-Marking Color |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|ACC|Red|
|CDJC|Purple|
|EDSC|Orange|
|EHC|White|
|HCCC|Yellow|
|NDSC|Green|
|SDCC|Lime Green|
|SJRC|Black|
|TTVC|Blue|
|ZVCC|Brick|

#### *Roll*-Playing vs. *Role*playing {#dice-id}
One of the many issues facing traditional (and often crunchy) roleplaying games is an overemphasis on rolling the dice (and far too much math). Some games, they shall go unnamed, have players and their referees roll (and perform some rather suspicious mathematical functions) for everything that takes place within the game space. Dice don’t need to be rolled every time an IHL does something in-game. The opposite should happen. Dice should be rolled only at important junctures when it is pivotal in determining the success of a given task, an application of resources, or even during tense negotiations that require a good deal of finesse, meaning dice rolls are used anytime failure might occur. **Pursuing *the* Dream** encourages **_role_**playing over **_roll-_**playing. 

> **Dice have their place here, too, but they shouldn’t suck the fun out of the game. When in doubt, roleplay, and then add dice into the mixture to complicate matters for players and their IHLs.**

#### Rulings, Not Rules {#rulings-id}
A common set of problems in many roleplaying games (and any game, for that matter) is the deadly combination of rules and rules-lawyering. In **Pursuing *the* Dream**, rules are not hard and fast. There is a good deal of room for negotiation, especially if an outcome can be made more exciting and more satisfying. Instead of fighting over the rules, players should negotiate with their referee. This means rulings should be made by the group, allowing for the game to be organic in its flow and less cumbersome if the rules presented have serious flaws inhibiting meaningful gameplay and experiences.

#### Player Skill {#skill-id}
Player skill is a must for **Pursuing *the* Dream**. Players will rely on their critical thinking, problem-solving, and roleplaying abilities to overcome challenges facing their IHLs. While each college has a **COLLEGE INFORMATION CARD**, these cards should not be viewed as religious texts written in stone, to be held high and venerated for their words and phrases. Instead, these information cards are living documents that assist players in navigating the higher learning industry in the state of Deseret, all the while offering up ways to tackle problems and score much-needed victory points. While dice can complicate matters, and the information cards can help players navigate the game space, referees will want to offer challenges that can be resolved with critical thinking, problem-solving, and roleplaying. This triumvirate of abilities is going to make for meaningful gameplay and experiences.

#### Who *Is* the Referee? {#referee-id}
The referee is the player (or possibly a group of players) who keeps order over the chaos, both in-game and in-session. The referee isn’t there to railroad storylines, stunt gameplay, or block constructive player-player interactions. A **_good_** referee will embrace the chaos, using rules (rather, rulings), meaningful (and constructive) player-player interactions, and specific moments in gameplay to help create an enriching experience for everyone including themselves. The referee, like the laws of physics, offers natural boundaries for acceptable gameplay and fantastic fun. Like gravity, the referee isn’t there to dole out meaningless consequences for actions (and inactions), but, rather, to make the consequences matter, make them fun, and, more importantly, make them consistent within the confines of the story and game world, as well as the gaming group’s expectations for realism.

#### Materials Needed for Successful Gameplay {#materials-id}
Like many strategy and roleplaying games, **Pursuing *the* Dream** requires additional outside materials **_plus_** what is found in this Referee Manual. It is recommended for in-person games that players have the following materials on hand:

**1)** Three (3) six-sided dice for each referee

**2)** Two (2) ten-sided dice per group (eleven sets minimum: one per IHL and one for the referee(s))

**3)** A printed copy of this manual

**4)** A variety of colored poker chips (larger, multicolored ones preferred here)

**5)** Colored pens, colored pencils, highlighters, and notebook or printer paper (for notes and strategizing)

**6)** Small printouts of the map of Deseret

**7)** A large (3’x3’ or 4’x4’) printout of the map of Deseret

**8)** A plethora of cheap (and multicolored) plastic tokens, 1-cm cubes, or glass gems (for map marking)

**9)** 12-inch rulers for each group (ten in total, at the very least)

**10)** Dry-erase board and dry erase markers for each group; large dry-erase board and markers for global announcements

**11)** A location where players can play this game comfortably (preferably a large space, where everyone can spread out safely and efficiently)

**12)** Time to play your game (preferably two to three hours)

**13)** A time-keeping device for time management during gameplay

**14)** Event tokens (see **03: Playing the Game** for details)

#### The Golden Rule {#golden-id}
In games like **Pursuing *the* Dream**, there exists a Golden Rule. This rule is simple, but it is often ignored by players who wish to be overly technical or wish to be rules lawyers or even realism fetishists. **This is a game**. As such, one should have fun—or at least try having fun. Players should remember that the final arbiter of rulings, realism, and boundaries is the game’s referee, who is interested in making sure the game keeps from stalling or falling victim to rules-lawyering, realism fetishes, and even chaos that threatens to derail everything. The **Golden Rule** is simple enough:

> **Don't be an asshole and have fun. This is a game after all.** 

#### Common Terminology {#terms-id}
To make the best of this manual, referees will want to familiarize themselves with several key pieces of terminology and abbreviations.

**Attribute:** Each IHL is broken down into six (6) core attributes, and these include Infrastructure (INFR), Capital (CAP), Vitality (VIT), Moxie (MOX), Influence (INFL), and Innovation (INN). These attributes provide an initial **_target number_** players **roll equal to or below to succeed**.

**Characteristics:** These are those qualities (or inequalities) found at a given IHL. Characteristics **_are not_** destiny, meaning they can be changed with a temporary sacrifice of earned victory points.

**d6:** This is a six-sided die, which is used to produce certain results that feed information to players via the referee. 

**d10:** This is a ten-sided die, which is used to produce certain results that feed information to players via the referee.

**d100:** This is a hundred-sided die, which is reproduced using two (2) ten-sided dice. One die serves as the tens digit, and the other serves as the ones digit. The highest value possible is **99**. The lowest possible value is **00**, which is read as zero (0).

**Difficulty Descriptors:** These are adjectives used to describe difficulty modifiers in-game. They comprise of ten (10) levels of difficulty, and these descriptors begin with **Effortless** and are capped at the highest difficulty, **Nearly Impossible**.

**Doubles:** Those numbers found on a d100 such as **00, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, and 99.** Rolling doubles means a team either receives a bonus (for rolling lower than the target number), or the team receives a penalty (for rolling higher than the target number).

**Non-Player Character (NPC):** A character who is portrayed by the referee, who may serve various purposes in-game, including members of (say) an accreditation body.

**Referee:** The player who portrays characters not controlled by the other players (i.e., NPCs), helps flesh out the story and setting for the game, and serves as the final arbiter when it comes to interpreting dice rolls, rulings, and consequences.

**Resources:** These are those things that provide **_special_** support for an IHL’s everyday operations. Resources include **material goods**, **monetary supports**, **human capital**, and **environmental conditions**. Environmental conditions cannot be changed, as this would require god-like abilities to reshape the environment, the geography, and even the very planet itself.

**Target Number:** This is a value calculated by the game’s referee, which begins with a given attribute (see [**03: Playing the Game**]({% link play.md %}) for more details) and goes from there.

**Victory Points (VP):** These are fungible assets that players earn from completing tasks or challenges. Victory points are awarded by the game’s referee. To that end, victory points can be sacrificed to buy new characteristics, new resources, and/or higher attribute scores.

#### Remember This, Folks {#remember-id}
When dealing with any game product, the referees and their fellow players are the final arbiters as to what should happen in-game. This is merely a sourcebook, a reference point, and not some sacred text to be held up high and venerated for what is written on its pages. Feel free to tweak, bend, break, and rewrite what you don’t like, what doesn’t work, and/or what doesn’t flow with your current understanding of the game itself.
