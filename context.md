#### Higher Education in Deseret
Funding for higher education in Deseret has a tumultuous history that has often produced uneven (and problematic) results. Most state flagships (and other larger institutions of higher learning) have seen favorable funding. However, rural institutions of higher learning have seen few years of favorable funding. These institutions have often experienced under-investment or disinvestment altogether. Recent changes to Deseret’s Department of Higher Learning (DHL) have pushed for more equitable funding models, meaning times may be changing for rural institutions that have long been neglected by the state’s legislature. Deseret’s new tuition assistance for working-class students, and its two-year funding guarantee for recent high school graduates, has made it possible for rural institutions to attract once unattainable student populations, allowing these IHLs to compete with larger (and wealthier) institutions across the state. In 2018, the State of Deseret, under guidance from the state’s Department of Higher Learning, implemented a standardized curriculum initiative to assist rural institutions in their ability to compete with their urban counterparts. This initiative incentivizes standardization at the 1000- and 2000-level courses across the state, so transferability between state institutions of higher learning is no longer bogged down by bureaucratic red tape and curriculum conflicts between institutions of higher learning.
